This is my bash resources!
If you use the ./install.sh script , and you already have plugins for vim i HIGHLY
recommend just blowing them away, with rm -rf ~/.vim/\*
however, if you need to keep some plugins, back them up
I recommend using a for loop in your bundle dir with git remote -v | grep fetch

# bash-resources
